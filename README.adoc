*Quick Introduction*

Spring Cloud Stream App Starters contain starter projects for various sources,
sinks and processors used in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream].

There is a convenient script provided to generate binder based Spring Boot
Applications for all the starters. Currently, it generates applications for both
Kafka and Rabbitmq based binders. These out of the box generated applications
are very basic in functionality and thus you may want to create similar apps
using the starters as a basis.

*Generating Out of the Box Binder based Apps*

----
$ ./generateApps.sh

$ cd apps

Here you will find the auto generated apps.
